# Changelog — @mongez/encryption

## Unreleased

### Fixed

- *(none yet — no behavioural changes since 1.0.4.)*

### Added

- **Test suite**. Vitest covering round-trip encrypt/decrypt across primitives, objects, arrays, unicode, very-long inputs, and the empty-string boundary; the explicit-driver overload (`AES`, `TripleDES`); known-answer vectors for `md5`/`sha1`/`sha256`/`sha512`; configuration-default semantics; and decrypt failure modes (wrong key, malformed cipher, empty string).
- **README** with a prominent **security notice** spelling out the threat model: these helpers wrap `crypto-js`'s passphrase-keyed AES-CBC + OpenSSL-style MD5 KDF; ciphertext is not authenticated; `md5`/`sha1` are not collision-resistant. Includes explicit "use for" / "do NOT use for" lists.
- **CHANGELOG**, **`llms.txt`**, **`llms-full.txt`**, and a **`skills/`** folder (`README`, `overview` with a security-boundaries section, `encrypt-decrypt`, `hashes`, `configuration`, `recipes`) for tool-assisted development.
- **`vitest.config.ts`** with the `node` environment and the self-detecting sibling-alias pattern used elsewhere in the workspace.
- **CI**. GitHub Actions workflow: Node 18/20/22 × Ubuntu, plus Node 20 × Windows.
- **`package.json` polish**. `sideEffects: false`, sharper `description`, expanded `keywords`, `vitest` and `typescript` dev-dependencies, `test` / `test:watch` scripts.

### Changed

- *(none — the public API is unchanged.)*

### Removed

- *(none.)*

### Tests

```
30 passing
```

### Known caveats (documented, not fixed)

- `decrypt` logs decode errors via `console.warn` and returns `null`. Callers cannot distinguish "wrong key" from "malformed input" from "tampered cipher" — the wrapper does not provide authentication, so by design it can only signal "did this round-trip as JSON or not."
- `encrypt(undefined)` round-trips to `undefined` (because `JSON.stringify({ data: undefined })` is `"{}"`, which decrypts and parses to `{}`, whose `.data` is `undefined`). This is a property of the JSON layer, not of the cipher.
- `encrypt` of a value containing circular references throws synchronously (from `JSON.stringify`) before any encryption happens — caller responsibility.
